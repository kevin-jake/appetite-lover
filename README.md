# Description of Project

Appetite Lover is an open-source platform for every food lover out there dedicated to gathering and sharing food feedback and finding the top 10 best food in Metro Manila, Philippines. By creating this, we believe that the feedback provided by the users will not only benefit fellow food enthusiasts but also help restaurant owners, chefs and even a small food cart in their continuous efforts to enhance their offerings and create exceptional eating experiences and of course promote their businesses as well.

Using this platform users will be able to search for a specific location in Metro Manila, Philippines or select from the map to find the Top 10 best food.

Users can provide feedback or recommend the restaurant, cafe or eatery to other food lovers as well.

Each "food spot" - as we call it, listed on the platform will have its dedicated page, showcasing key information such as reviews, menu and location. This page will display aggregated reviews and ratings from users, allowing visitors to gain insights into the overall customer sentiment.

## Inspiration for the Application

The idea of the application came up while we are eating at a Ramen restaurant. We have thought of the problem that when you are new to a place you usually find yourself having a hard time finding an eating place. This is where we started to conceptualize a community-based-driven food review application that will showcase the top eating spots in a specific area.

The UI experience is heavily inspired by a recent viral web project in the Philippines: [https://www.my-philippines-travel-level.com/](https://www.my-philippines-travel-level.com/). This site shows a simple map of the Philippines and will just let visitors of the map select a region and mark it once they have been there. Then it will import an image filled with colors of places the visitor has been through. This image can then be shared across all social media platforms.

Our idea is to use the same map but it would take us time in the data-gathering process. This is where we have decided to start small and focus on Metro Manila for now.

Our goal in this project is to provide food enthusiasts with a platform where they can discover and share the top eating spots in specific areas.

# Statement of the Problem

In the bustling city of Metro Manila, renowned as the capital of the Philippines. This place offers lots of dining experiences. Most of the time we encounter difficulties and spent a lot of time locating the satisfying best place to eat especially if we are in a hurry or unfamiliar places.

As food lovers like ourselves, we are very particular about the feedback of the customers because we believed that customer reviews are the reflection of the quality of service and food experiences.

Therefore, we come up with the platform "Appetite Lover" as a solution to the problem.
